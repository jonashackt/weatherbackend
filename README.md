> usable for other applications (e.g. [soap-mule-cxf](https://github.com/jonashackt/soap-mule-cxf)) or to show some REST-Calling stuff (e.g. with [rest-assured](https://github.com/rest-assured/rest-assured) or [unirest.io](http://unirest.io/java.html))

I added the really nice Swaggerfox-UI - just fire up WeatherBackendApplication and go to [http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html](http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html)
